        <p>You roll the window down and crawl out! You swim to the shore, and collapse onto the ground. You turn around just in time to see the top of your car sink below the surface of the water. Your map, your phone, all your belongingsâ€¦ gone to a watery grave. At least you didn't go with it.
        </p>
        <p>After wandering and calling for help for hours, you come across a run-down cabin. Finally some good news! You knock on the door. <br><span class="amara">"Hello? Is anyone home?"</span>
        </p>

        <p>There's no response, but you swear you saw movement through the window.</p>
