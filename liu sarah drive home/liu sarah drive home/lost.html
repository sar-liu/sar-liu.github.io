        <p>The faster you can get out of these woods, the better.<br>
            You continue wandering for hours in the pitch darkness, exhausted, hungry, and completely lost. You take another step, when suddenly an excruciating pain shoots through your leg and you collapse onto the ground screaming! In the moonlight, you can see your leg caught in a bear trap!
        </p>
        <p>With the last of your strength, you scream for help, but no one hears you.</p>
