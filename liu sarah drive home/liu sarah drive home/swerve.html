            <p> You glance down from the road to see the dozens of heart emojis your girlfriend ended the text with.
                Laughing, you’re about to respond when something big and furry darts into the road in front of you!
            </p>

                Startled, you swerve to avoid it, the world moving in slow motion as you plummet off the road and into the river. Your car isn't submerged yet, but water is up to your waist and getting higher by the second.
            </p>
            <p>You need to get out NOW.</p>
