            After a few hours' drive, you step out of their car, back at your apartment.
        </p>

        <img class="face" src="images/amara-smile.png" alt="">
        <p>
            <span class="amara"> "Thanks again, I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't found me." </span><br>
            <span class="eden"> "No problem… but Amara? Can I ask you for a favor?</span> <br>
            <span class="amara">"Yeah, what is it?"</span> <br>
            They unclip the colored lenses from their glasses, fiddling with it in their hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="eden">"Can you keep what you saw last night between us, please?"</span> <br>
            <span class="amara">"Huh? What do you mean-" </span><br>
            They look at you, and you see their eyes for the first time. Bright yellow. Glowing.
        </p>
        <img class="face" src="images/eden-look.png" alt="">
        <p>
            At that moment, Rei bursts out the door and throws her arms around you, knocking you off balance.
        </p>
        <img class="face" src="images/rei.png" alt="">
        <p>
            <span class="rei">"Oh thank God! I was so scared you were… That's it, you can never leave again!" </span><br>
            When you glance back at the road, Eden is nowhere to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good ending.
        </p>
